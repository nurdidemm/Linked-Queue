# Linked-Queue
An implementation of a customer service queue as a LinkedList. The program models a group of customers and a service-counter on a typical day from 9am to 5pm, using queues.

Input: 

--> customersfile.txt  :  has the customersâ€™ information, such that each customer has one "paragraph" of two lines, with at least one blank line between one paragraph and the next. The format of the paragraph of a customer is:

ID-NUMBER: a unique integer customer id 
ARRIVAL-TIME: hh:mm:ss

The first line of customersfile.txt is an unsigned positive integer, representing the constant service time per customer, in seconds.

--> queriesfile.txt  :  will have a sequence of queries, one query per line, where the queries can be:

WAITING-TIME-OF customer-id // measured in seconds NUMBER-OF-CUSTOMERS-SERVED
LONGEST-BREAK-LENGTH // measured in seconds 
TOTAL- IDLE-TIME // measured in seconds MAXIMUM-NUMBER-OF-PEOPLE-IN-QUEUE-AT-ANY-TIME

call it from the command-line like this:
>> Program2 customersfile.txt queriesfile.txt
